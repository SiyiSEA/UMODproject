# UMODproject
This repo summarizes my Master's thesis, which aims to predict the potential relationship between UMOD (uromodulin) and blood pressure at both the molecular and cellular levels.

# Abstract
Hypertension (long-term high blood pressure) is a chronic disease and risk factor for many cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Uromodulin encoded by UMOD gene is a glycoprotein secreted by cells on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The UMOD plays a vital role in hypertension regulation. Still, the potential genetic and cellular mechanisms between UMOD’s role and high blood pressure induced by high salt are unknown. This project will predict a potential relationship between UMOD and blood pressure at both molecule and cellular levels. Through analysis and compersion on bulk RNAseq data from knock out (UMOD-/-) mice with normal salt diet and supplemented salt diet(2%NaCl) as well as wild type (UMOD+/+) mice with normal salt diet and supplemented salt diet(2%NaCl), we are able to identify significant expression genes. Based on the genes, pathway analyses(Gene-set enrichment analysis and over-representation analysis) were applied to identify enrichment pathways. To further investigate the relationship between UMOD and renal cell types, the deconvolution method(SCDC) was used to estimate the cell types proportion in bulk RNAseq and generated gene lists based on the cell types for further pathway analysis. As a result, we identified heat shock protein genes(BiP) significantly expressed, interacting with UMOD. There are two significantly pathways identified, unfolded protein response(p.adj=1E-11.7) and mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) signalling pathway(p.adj<0.01). Furthermore, cells in the thick ascending loop of Henle are significant changes(p.adj <0.05), which are associated with the tight junction signalling pathway. Our results suggest that the UMOD impacts the endoplasmic reticulum stress by regulating the protein folding process and interaction with BiP, which could further affect apoptosis. Additionally, the UMOD also controls the ciliated epithelial cells’ tight junction on the thick ascending loop of Henle to avoid solute leak out. This project provides further insights into the relationship between UMOD and unfolded protein response and MAPK signalling pathways, as well as UMOD and ciliated epithelial cells on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.
